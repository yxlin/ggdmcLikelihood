Description: This package provides a user interface for efficiently computing likelihoods in design-based choice response time models. It is built to integrate with the 'ggdmc' package, enabling rapid initialisation of starting samples for genetic algorithms, which typically use a large number of Markov chains. The likelihood computation supports both single-subject and multi-subject models. Implemented methods include fast evaluation of likelihoods across trial-level data, support for various response time distributions (e.g., diffusion models). Ideal for cognitive scientists and decision modellers, this tool enhances the usability and computational performance of complex model fitting tasks in experimental psychology and behavioral data research.
