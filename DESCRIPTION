Description: Efficient computation of likelihoods in design-based choice response time models, including the Decision Diffusion Model, is supported. The package enables rapid evaluation of likelihood functions for both single- and multi-subject models across trial-level data. It also offers fast initialisation of starting parameters for genetic sampling with many Markov chains, facilitating estimation in complex models typically found in experimental psychology and behavioural science. These optimisations help reduce computational overhead in large-scale model fitting tasks.
